# This file contains common pin mappings for the BIGTREETECH EBBCan
# Canbus board. To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the
# STM32G0B1 with "8 MHz crystal" and "USB (on PA11/PA12)" or "CAN bus (on PB0/PB1)".
# The "EBB Can" micro-controller will be used to control the components on the nozzle.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.
